# BVTKNodes 

[The Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](https://www.vtk.org/) is an open
source library for scientific data processing and visualization.
BVTKNodes is an addon for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
This addon makes it possible to create and execute VTK pipelines
configured in Blender Node Editor, to produce surface mesh objects,
which can be then modified and visualized in Blender.

BVTKNodes provides Blender users access to data readers for many
scientific data formats, along with capability to convert VTK data
into Blender mesh. For VTK users, the add-on provides access to high
quality and photorealistic rendering and many kind of mesh editing tools.
The add-on was first presented at
[Blender Conference 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcF4LBTTyvk).
You can see more examples in
[a gallery thread on blenderartists](https://blenderartists.org/t/bvtknodes-gallery/1161079).
