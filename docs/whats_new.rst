==========

This information applies to the
`tkeskita/bvtknodes <https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes>`_ version.

Version 0.10
------------

- 2023-01-21: Upgrade to Blender LTS version 3.3 (Python 3.10) and VTK 9.2.2.
  The previous Blender LTS version 2.93 (Python 3.9) still works as well
  with VTK 9.2.2.

Version 0.9
-----------

- 2022-07-28: Color Mapper Node now supports vector arrays as well as
  scalar arrays as input. For vectors, magnitude of the vector is used
  for the color scale.

- 2022-06-12: Changed Custom Filter to fix it's tree import/export.

- 2022-06-05: Fixed importing of colors for Color Ramp node.

- 2022-05-28: Fixed Property listing bug for Blender 2.93 (properties were not
  shown in the Properties tab).

- 2022-05-28: Added VTK To Blender Image Node to convert vtkImageData
  to a Blender Image.

Version 0.8 (2022-01-16)
------------------------

- Upgrade to Blender LTS version 2.93 and VTK 9.1.0. The previous
  Blender LTS version 2.83 still works as well with VTK 9.1.0.

Version 0.7 (2021-09-18)
------------------------

- Supported Blender LTS version 2.83 and VTK 9.0.1.
- New node update system, where VTK updates are independent of node
  editing actions. User has now option to change **Update Mode** in
  the Inspect Panel, which determines when changes in nodes are
  updated to VTK objects. Most useful options include *No Automatic
  Updates* and *Update All Automatically*.

- Nodes have now :ref:`node_status` information, which is shown by node colors.

- Values of dynamic enumeration lists are stored in string properties,
  so that it is possible to pre-define whole node trees without need to
  run updates on nodes. This allows full pre-definition of node trees
  e.g. for JSON imports.

- several new *cubeflow* node tree examples (in
  :ref:`json_importexport` Tab) available for :ref:`ug_nodes`.

- Development for this release was made in 
  `pull request #46 <https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/pull/46>`_.


Previous versions
-----------------

- A testing framework helps developers catch regression bugs.

- :ref:`global_time_keeper` node allows animation of many node properties
  by Blender's Keyframes feature.

- Improved Custom Code editing.

- Matplotlib color maps are available as presets in Color Ramp node.

- Several bug fixes and small usability improvements.
